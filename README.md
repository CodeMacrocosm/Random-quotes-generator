# Introduction 

🎤🔀 A Python Tkinter GUI app that delivers a fresh dose of random Kanye West quotes with just a click.


## Features 

- Fetches random Kanye West quotes from 🌟 [https://api.kanye.rest](https://api.kanye.rest).
- Displays the fetched quote on a visually appealing GUI.
- User-friendly interface with a button to get a new quote.

## Dependencies 

- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html): Python's standard GUI package.
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/): Used for making HTTP requests to the Kanye West quotes API.

## How It Works 

1. The app initializes a Tkinter window with a canvas and a button.
2. The canvas displays a background image and the current Kanye West quote.
3. Upon clicking the button, the `get_quote` function is triggered.
4. The function makes an API call to [https://api.kanye.rest](https://api.kanye.rest) using the `requests` library.
5. The received quote is then displayed on the canvas.
